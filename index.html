                I used to work in the hospitality industry and in March 2012 I
                received a Bowen treatment for my shoulders. I could not believe
                the effectiveness of the treatment! This triggered me to want to
                learn more about the technique, and to be able to offer other
                people the benefits and relief that I experienced. Dogs have
                always been a big part of my life and love being in their
                company, So to be able to have a therapy that is beneficial to
                dogs and people is just amazing.
              </p>
              <p class="about-text">
                I have been fully qualified in human bowen since 2013 and canine
                bowen since 2015. In April 2023 I became a reiki practitioner, I
                feel reiki is a lovely therapy to add to my list!
              </p>
              <p class="about-text">
                Both therapies are gentle, non-invasive and performed through
                light clothing. I work out of my beautiful garden cabin from my
                home, in a quiet area of Frome, Somerset, my goal is to help you
                and when you walk out of my door I will keep in touch and see
                how you are doing, my door is always open for a chat and I hope
                you will always feel relaxed and comfortable in my company.

              <ul class="about-work-list">
                <li class="about-work-list-item">
                  <img

                  <span>
                    The Bowen technique is a holistic therapy, which means
                    treating the body as a “whole” and not focusing on specific
                    conditions or symptoms.</span
                  >
                </li>

                    alt="Bowen Head Toe Tail"
                  />
                  The technique consists of a series of rolling type moves,
                  across muscle, tendons and other soft tissue.
                </li>
                <li class="about-work-list-item">

                    alt="Bowen Head Toe Tail"
                  />
                  I would use fingers and thumbs on specific areas, applying
                  gentle pressure to effect a movement on the tissue.
                </li>
                <li class="about-work-list-item">
                  <img

                  The Bowen technique can be used as a treatment for many common
                  issues such as:
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Back and neck pain</li>
                  <li>Sciatica</li>
                  <li>Sports injuries</li>
                  <li>Joint pain</li>
                  <li>Infant colic</li>
                  <li>Sporting and working dogs</li>
                  <li>Stress and anxiety</li>
                  <li>Ageing</li>
                  <li>Palliative care</li>
                  <li>And many many more</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="about-work-list-item">
                  <img

                    alt="Bowen Head Toe Tail"
                  />
                  Canine bowen works in a very similar way to treating people,
                  the moves are the same, but the sessions are led by the dog to
                  go at their own pace..
                </li>
                <li class="about-work-list-item">
                  <img
                    src="./images/bowenhtt-logo-green.svg"
                    alt="Bowen Head Toe Tail"
                  />
                  With Canine Bowen I travel to treat them in their own home,
                  this is where the dog is most relaxed.
                </li>
                <li class="about-work-list-item">
                  <img

                  />
                  It’s important to say I DO NOT make claims to treat or cure
                  specific conditions and you should ALWAYS consult your Dr /
                  Vet if you have ANY concerns about yourself or your dog.

                  Upon arrival and meeting your dog a full medical history is
                  taken, this gives me a bigger picture to work out areas that
                  could be a discomfort for your dog. The treatment pace is
                  completely lead by your dog and this is really important that
                  they have the freedom and space to come and go as they please,
                  this also helps me gain the trust and respect from your dog.
                </p>
                <p class="treatments-tab-data-text full-size">
                  A course of 3 treatments over a period of 4-5 weeks is
                  recommended for most canine companions.

                    >Canine bowen is lovely for our golden oldies often
                    suffering with stiffness, its gentle and non-invasive and to
                    often see the changes in the dogs is wonderful, more energy,
                    less stiffness, an interest in life again and more
                    interaction with their family life, its always lovely to
                    hear the feedback.</span
